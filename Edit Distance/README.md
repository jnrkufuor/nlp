# Edit Distance

### Overview
This python script helps calculate the edit distance between two words. The edit distance is a way to identify how different two strings are by counting the number of operations needed to transform one into the other. This code contains how to calculate the edit distance using:

- Levenshtein distance
- Levenshtein distance with Transpositionn
- Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance
